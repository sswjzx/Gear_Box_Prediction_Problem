# Gear_Box_Prediction_Problem
This was a part of hackathon conducted by Flutura solutions.The problem statement was to predict Gear Box Failure based on various sensor data which were recorded at different time stamps.So first challenge was to normalize the data to a common time stamp and then I did basic Data exploration and now filling the missing values by extrapolation techniques and then have built a basic model by using xgboost. Now using p1 scores eliminated the features and then have built a new model using only some features.
